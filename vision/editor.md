# Vision for the Level / Game Editor

This document describes how we envision the Game Editor. This helps us set our goals and milestones.

## Ease of use

One of the major goals will be a simple to use editor. Everybody should be able to create levels in it at best
in a playful manner. 

### WYSIWYG

The Editor should have a kinda WYSIWYG feeling. Composing stuff by putting them in different places should
be sufficient to create levels.

### Game Modes

Customization comes via Game Modes. Those are a preset of rules, enemies that define a cohesive game experience.

### Sharability

It should be simple to share levels publically or for play testing with other players. It might be
interesting to have a playtested badge for levels to have some quality assessment.

## Powerful

The game becomes interesting if it can produce new experiences. This requires that the community can
leverage the given tools to create more than we anticipated. The editor should have an easy to
learn hard to master feel where you can put hours into creating exactly what you want.

### Fine tuning

The feeling of how you play the game is really important and it is the players who understand the
details of "what is good and what not". It should be possible to fine tune game physics, enemies, hit boxes
etc..

### Extensibility

The community as a whole is more creative than any dev-team with designers. We want to allow
players and creators to create new stuff that we did not think of like custom powerups,
special coins that unlock stuff, overworlds etc..
